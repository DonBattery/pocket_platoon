- In the spirit of Pico-8 the whole source code is open source.
- The music (Gruber Jam - Space Lizards) is royalty free, so you can also use it in your Pico-8 games.
- You can use the pictures from the sprite sheet as you like.
- The only thing you cannot use is the name of the game (Pocket Platoon) and the Label image.
